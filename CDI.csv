These NMAs were 22 cents for LDPE, 19 cents for LLDPE B1, and they were 21 cents per pound for our dual comonomer LLDPE Hexene & Octene (HAO) film grade resin indices. NMAs are used to correct the growth in price discounts seen over the past several years as well as discounts expected for new contracts in 2018.
